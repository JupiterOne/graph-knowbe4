# Development

KnowBe4 is a security-awareness training provider.

## Prerequisites

The integration uses `fetch` for communicating with the REST API.

## Provider account setup

The provider does not provide free, trial, or sandbox accounts. 
Also, tokens for the API have full access to the account, and so
real account owners are reluctant to provide them. 

If you can get valid credentials, see ./jupiterone.md for details on 
provisioning the API connection.

## Authentication

To authenticate, present your API token in an Authorization header in 
requests (`Authorization: 'Bearer {TOKEN}'`).

The `site` config variable is a modifier to the base URL used for the 
REST API, which is `https://${config.site.toLowerCase()}.api.knowbe4.com/v1`.
Valid sites include `us` and `eu`.
